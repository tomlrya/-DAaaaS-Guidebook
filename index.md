The Data Analytics as a Service (DAaaS) platform is a large-scale federal government project led by Statistics Canada (StatCan) to address the immediate needs of internal and external stakeholders for having a centralized data science and analysis platform. This platform was conceptualized a few years earlier but the demand to address increased agility needs of data analysis related to Covid-19 reporting country-wide accelerated its development.
<br> <br>
Geospatial analysis is a major requirement of this project and it includes a larger road map that aims at modernizing the current geospatial capabilities by a shift to the DAaaS cloud infrastructure (Microsoft Azure). The solution named DAaaS Geo will be designed as part of the larger DAaaS Platform (Hub) and will focus on providing a hybrid solution, integrating data, services and applications hosted on-premises, cloud infrastructure as a service-based primarily on ArcGIS Enterprise enhanced with open source tools and options.
