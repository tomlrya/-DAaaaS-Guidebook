**User Roles**<br/>
You will be assigned either a *Project Viewer* or *Project Member* user role depending on your needs. 

- **Project Viewer**<br/>
  View items such as maps, apps, scenes, and layers that have been shared with the public, the organization, or a group to which the member belongs. Join groups owned by the organization. Drag CSV, text, or GPX files into Map Viewer Classic (formerly Map Viewer) to geocode addresses or place names. Get directions in a map viewer and apps. Members assigned the Viewer role cannot create or share content, or perform analysis.

- **Project Member**<br/>
  Project Viewer privileges plus the ability to create, update and delete their own content. Users can publish hosted feature layers, hosted tile layers, hosted scene layers, and server-based layers. Share content to assigned groups. Create content such as Maps (including feature analysis tasks), Dashboards, Apps, and Story Maps.
