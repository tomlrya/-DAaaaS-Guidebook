If you forget the password of your virtual machine:

2. Contact the support team through the [Jira GEO Support Board](https://jirab.statcan.ca/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1452&view=detail)(NET B).

#### What do I do if I need to run a long running job on my virtual machine?
Machines are shut down every day at 7pm CST in order to reduce costs. 

If you have a long-running job, it is recommended that you migrate your process to an Azure servuce; ie- **Databricks or Data Factory**. DAaaS GEO and CAE can provide support and technical assistance at your request to help you migrate.
